# Desk Music Studio
# SE 370 Project
# Our Project will be able to run music with user interaction to Load files, Save files, Play, Pause, Loop, and Repeat .mp3 or .txt files. As well as Creating Notes to modify or play notes and implement them from Controllers like Section View's KeyBoard to Track View's Display of instruments.
